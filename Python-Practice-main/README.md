# Python-Practice
This repo is meant to hold many small python scripts being completed to keep python fresh in my mind.

The most interesting programs can be found in the algorithms folder. For the most part, this repo is structured so that for every library built there is an associated test file. if there is a library named <lib>.py then the test file is <lib>_test.py. For example, the dynamicProgramming.py lib is tested by dynamicProgramming_test.py. You can run the test file to test the corresponding library.
